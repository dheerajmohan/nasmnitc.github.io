<h3>Machine Language</h3>

Machine language consists of instructions in the form of 0s and 1s. Every CPU
has its own machine language. It is very difficult to write programs using the
combination of 0s and 1s. So we rely upon either assembly language or high level
language for writing programs.

<h3>Assembly Language</h3>

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for microprocessors
and other programmable devices.Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent
each low-level machine instruction.

<h3>Why Assembly Language ?</h3>

The symbolic programming of Assembly Language is easier to understand and
saves a lot of time and effort of the programmer. When you study assembly lan-
guage, you will get a better idea of computer organization and how a program
executes in a computer. A program written in assembly language will be more
efficient than the same program written in a high level language. Some portions
of Linux kernel and some system softwares are written in assembly language. In
programming languages like C, C++ we can even embed assembly language instructions into it using functions like asm( ); (Refer to Chapter 8 of The Intel
Microprocessors by Barry B. Brey for more details)

<h3>What is NASM ?</h3>

The Netwide Assembler is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel X86 ar-
chitecture(explained in subsequent section).It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit
(IA-32) and 64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be one of the most
popular assemblers for Linux.

<h3>Computer Architecture</h3>

The basic operational design of a computer is called architecture.It is a set of rules
and methods that describe the functionality,organization and implementation of
computer systems.X86 architecture follows Von Newmann architecture which is
based on stored program concept.

<h3>Von Neumann Architecture</h3>

A Von Neumann architecture machine, designed by physicist and mathematician
John von Neumann (19031957) is a theoretical design for a stored program com-
puter that serves as the basis for almost all modern computers. A von Neumann
machine consists of a central processor with an arithmetic/logic unit and a control
unit, a memory, mass storage, and input and output.

<h3>X86 Architecture NASM</h3>

The x86 architecture is an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) series for computer
processors. Developed by Intel Corporation, x86 architecture defines how a proces-
sor handles and executes different instructions passed from the operating system
(OS) and software programs. The x in x86 denotes ISA version.
Key features include:
<ul>
  <li> Provides a logical framework for executing instructions through a processor.</li>
  <li>Allows software programs and instructions to run on any processor in the
Intel 8086 family.</li>
  <li>Provides procedures for utilizing and managing the hardware components of
a central processing unit (CPU).</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border-color: black;">
Historically there have been 2 types of Computers: Fixed Program Computers
Their function is very specific and they cant be programmed, e.g. Calculators.
Stored Program Computers These can be programmed to carry 36 out many dif-
ferent tasks, applications are stored on them, hence the name.

<h3>Processor</h3>

Processor is the brain of the computer. It performs all mathematical, logical and
control operations of a computer. It is that component of the computer which
executes all the instructions given to it in the form of programs. It interacts with
I/O devices, memory (RAM) and secondary storage devices and thus implements
the instructions given by the user.
<br><br>
The term processor is used interchangeably with the term central processing unit
(CPU), although strictly speaking, the CPU is not the only processor in a com-
puter.

<h3>Registers</h3>
Registers are the most immediately accessible memory units for the processor.
They are the fastest among all the types of memory. They reside inside the processor and the processor can access the contents of any register in a single clock
cycle. It is the working memory for a processor, i.e , if we want the processor to
perform any task it needs the data to be present in any of its registers.


<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">What is a clock cycle? </span><br>
In computers, the clock cycle is the amount of time between two pulses of
an oscillator. It is a single increment of the central processing unit (CPU)
clock during which the smallest unit of processor activity is carried out.
The clock cycle helps in determining the speed of the CPU, as it is
considered the basic unit of measuring how fast an instruction can be
executed by the computer processor.
</p>

The series of processors released on or after 80186 like 80186, 80286, 80386, Pentium etc are referred to as x86 or 80x86 processors. The processors released on or
after 80386 are called I386 processors. They are 32 bit processors internally and
externally. So their register sizes are generally 32 bit. In this section we will go
through the I386 registers.

<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px; padding: 15px;">
Intel maintains its backward compatibility of instruction sets, i.e, we can
run a program designed for an old 16 bit machine in a 32bit machine.
That is the reason why we can install 32-bit OS in a 64 bit PC. The only
problem is that, the program will not use the complete set of registers and
other available resources and thus it will be less efficient.
</p>

A register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data (such as
a bit sequence or individual characters). A register must be large enough to hold
an instruction - for example, in a 64-bit computer, a register must be 64 bits in
length.
